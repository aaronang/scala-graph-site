<h1><b>Constrained</b> User Guide</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This module enables the user of <i>Graph for Scala</i> to seamlessly integrate predefined
or custom constraints. Constraints are meant to ensure certain graph properties
during the whole lifetime of graph instances which are not enforceable through
type parameters. Examples for common constraints are <i>connected, acyclic, tree,
planar</i> etc. Furthermore, the user is free to provide a custom constraint
implementation covering any domain-specific requirements.</p>

<p>Predefined constraints are placed in <kbd>scalax.collection.constrained.constraints</kbd>
but currently few predefined constraints are provided. We would certainly be obliged
if you contributed your constraint implementation to enhance the library.</p>

<p>Graphs may be constrained dynamically or statically. A graph is called
dynamically constrained if a constraint has been passed to its factory method on
creation or if it is a result of an operation based on a dynamically constrained graph:</p>

<pre>
import scalax.collection.GraphPredef._,
       scalax.collection.GraphEdge._
import scalax.collection.constrained._
import scalax.collection.constrained.constraints.Connected

implicit val conf: Config = Connected            // ConstrainedConfig(...)

val e = Graph(1~2, 3~4)                                         // Graph()
val g = Graph(1~2, 2~4)                        // Graph(1, 2, 4, 1~2, 2~4)
val h = g + 3                                  // Graph(1, 2, 4, 1~2, 2~4)
val i = g + 2~3                        // Graph(1, 2, 3, 4, 1~2, 2~3, 2~4)
</pre>
