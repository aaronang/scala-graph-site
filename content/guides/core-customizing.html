<h1>Core User Guide: Customizing Graphs</h1>
<p>
	You can start to utilize <code>Graph</code> out of the box but often you want
	to achieve a certain degree of customization. Basically, the following kinds
	of customization are eligible:
</p>
<h2>Altering Configuration Options</h2>
<p>
	In the default implementation, adjacency lists are represented by
	<code>ArraySet</code>s, a specific collection type included in Graph-core.
	<code>ArraySet</code>s bank on JVM native arrays to provide higher performance.
</p>
<p>
	Mostly you can go with the default
	<code>ArraySet</code>
	settings which were chosen by careful measurements. In production
	however, it may be desirable to tune them. Based on the node density
	and density distribution of your graphs you can determine up to which
	number of neighbors the underlying
	<code>ArraySet</code>
	s should use arrays. Once this limit is reached,
	<code>ArraySet</code>
	will transparently switch from the array to hash set representation.
</p>
<p>
	Let
	<code>g</code>
	be your
	<code>Graph</code>
	instance. Then
</p>
<p>
	<code>g.config</code>
</p>
<p>
	returns the immutable configuration for
	<code>g</code>
	. To override these settings, define your own implicit value prior to
	<code>Graph</code>
	creation:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">import scalax.collection.config.CoreConfig
import scalax.collection.mutable.ArraySet.Hints
implicit val myConfig = CoreConfig(Hints(64, 0, 64, 75))
</pre>
<p>
	In the above example, both the initial array capacity and the hash set
	limit are set to
	<code>64</code>
	. These values would be preferable for
	<code>Graph</code>
	s with an average node degree of roughly 30 to 55 for the majority of
	the nodes. For more details please refer to the Scaladoc of
	<code>ArraySet.Hints</code>
	or request for service.
</p>
<h2>Enriching Graph</h2>
<p> You may want to add new methods to the library implementation of
	<code>Graph</code> or its inner traits <code>InnerNodeLike</code>,
	<code>NodeSet</code>, <code>InnerEdgeLike</code> or <code>EdgeSet</code>.
	Adding new methods to Graph may be achieved by the standard <em>enrich
	my library</em> pattern using <code>implicit</code> functions.
</p>
<p> To enrich <code>Graph</code> with one or more methods you might expand
	the following template:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">final class ExtGraph[N, E[X] <: EdgeLikeIn[X]](g: Graph[N,E]) {
  def &lt;yourMethodSignature&gt; &lt;yourMethodBody&gt;
}
implicit def gToExtG[N, E[X] <: EdgeLikeIn[X]](g: Graph[N,E]) =
  new ExtGraph[N,E](g)
</pre>
<p>	To enrich the inner <code>type NodeT</code> is more subtle:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">final class ExtGraphNode[N, E[X] <: EdgeLikeIn[X]](node_ : Graph[N,E]#NodeT) {
  type NodeT = graph.NodeT
  val graph = node_.containingGraph
  val node  = node_.asInstanceOf[NodeT]
  def ... // your method
}
implicit def nodeToExtN[N, E[X] <: EdgeLikeIn[X]] (node: Graph[N,E]#NodeT) =
  new ExtGraphNode[N,E](node)
</pre>

</p>
<h2>Defining Custom Edges</h2>
<p>You may decide to bypass the predefined edge classes and design your
	own edge type. Recapping the <code>Flight</code> label example,
	it is also possible to define a custom edge type <code>Flight</code>.
	With such a custom edge type you can create <code>Graph</code> instances
	of the type <code>Graph[Airport, Flight]</code>.
	For the sake of simplicity we design the <code>Flight</code> edge to have
	the only attribute <code>flightNo</code>. Given the node class
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">case class Airport(val code: String) // node type
val (ham, ny) = (Airport("HAM"), Airport("JFK")) // two nodes
</pre>
<p>assume we want to be able to write</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala nolinenum">val flight = ham ~> ny ## "007"	// flightNo 007 - doesn't work yet
val g = Graph(flight) // Graph[Airport, Flight] - doesn't work yet
</pre>
<p>
	<a name="RichViewCheckpoint0"></a> Here is how to achieve the above
	requirements:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala linenums"
>class Flight[N](nodes: Product, val flightNo: String)
  extends DiEdge[N](nodes)
  with    ExtendedKey[N]
  with    EdgeCopy[Flight]
  with    EdgeIn[N,Flight]
{
  def keyAttributes = Seq(flightNo)
  override def copy[NN](newNodes: Product) =
    new Flight[NN](newNodes, flightNo)
}
object Flight {
  def apply(from: Airport, to: Airport, no:String) =
    new Flight[Airport](NodeProduct(from, to), no)
  def unapply(e: Flight[Airport]): Option[(Airport,Airport,String)] =
      if (e eq null) None else Some(e.from, e.to, e.flightNo)
}
final class FlightAssoc[A <: Airport](val e: DiEdge[A]) {
  @inline def ## (flightNo: String) =
    new Flight[A](e.nodes, flightNo) with EdgeIn[A,Flight]
}
implicit def edge2FlightAssoc[A <: Airport](e: DiEdge[A]) =
  new FlightAssoc[A](e)
</pre>
<p>As to</p>
<ol>
	<li value="2"><code>DiEdge</code> should be the base of any directed custom
		edge. <code>Airport</code> is the node type.</li>
	<li>If any of the label attributes is part of the key of the edge
		type, <code>ExtendedKey</code> must be mixed in. An attribute is a key
		if it must be considered by <code>eauals</code>. <code>flightNo</code>
		is such a key attribute because there may exist several flights from
		and to the same airport so we distinguished them by <code>flightNo</code>.
	</li>
	<li>All edge implementations must mix in <code>EdgeCopy</code>.
	</li>
	<li>All edge implementations must mix in <code>EdgeIn</code>.
	</li>
	<li value="7">Key attributes must be added to this <code>Seq</code>.
	</li>
	<li><code>copy</code> will be called by <code>Graph</code>
		transparently to create an inner edge. Thus <code>copy</code> plays
		the role of an inner edge factory. It must return an instance of the
		edge class.
	</li>
	<li value="12">This standard <code>apply</code> makes use of <code>NodeProduct</code>
		which creates a <code>Product</code> of the arguments.
	</li>
	<li value="17">Establishes the <code>Flight</code> edge factory shortcut
		<code>##</code> which converts a directed edge to <code>Flight</code>.
	</li>
	<li value="21">Enables the implicit usage of the <code>##</code> operator.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Note that the supplied tests contain a more complete implementation of
	the flight example - see <code>Flight.scala</code>, <code>TFlight.scala</code>
	and <code>FlightRouteMap.jpg</code> in the repository.
</p>
<p>In general, when deciding on how to define your custom edge, the
	following steps apply:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Decide on which predefined 	edge class is to derive from.
		These are enlisted in <em>2.3 Edge 	Factories</em>.
	</li>
	<li>If your edge type is labeled by one or more attributes, decide
		for each attribute whether it counts as a key or as a non-key
		attribute. You have to deal with key attributes only in case your
		graph is to be laid out for multi-edges. Then, similar to SQL database
		primary key design, those attributes making an edge unique must be
		defined as key attributes.<br>If you have one or more key
		attributes, mix in <code>ExtendedKey</code> and enter all key
		attributes into the list returned by <code>def keyAttributes</code>
		which you must override.<br>For any non-key attribute it is
		sufficient to be added as a constructor parameter.
	</li>
	<li><code>EdgeCopy</code> must always be mixed in to override its
		abstract method <code>copy</code>.</li>
	<li>If you want to avoid any loop in your graph, you can achieve
		this by simply mixing in <code>LoopFreeEdge</code>.
	</li>
	<li>If your edges are weighted you may have selected either&nbsp;
		<code>WUnDiEdge</code> or <code>WDiEdge</code> in (B). If <code>weight</code>
		is your single custom attribute you don't need to implement a custom
		edge. Otherwise you can use these predefined classes as a template to
		define your own weighted custom edge.
	</li>
	<li>In your custom edge class you are free to override <code>validate</code>
		that is called at edge instantiation time. For instance, the
		predefined <code>validate</code> ensures that no edge can be
		instantiated with any of its ends being <code>null</code>.
	</li>
	<li>Optionally, customize <code>toString</code>. Notice that <code>EdgeLike</code>
		comes with several protected methods for prefixes, braces etc.such as<code>
			attributesToString</code> which just need to be overridden. Thus they remove
		the burden of programming <code>toString</code> from the bottom up.
	</li>
	<li>Add a type and an<code> implicit</code> <code>def</code> to
		make passing of the custom edge to <code>Graph</code> methods easy.
	</li>
	<li>Optionally, design and implement your custom edge factory
		shortcut. Doing this you may also opt to use the standard edge factory
		shortcuts <code>~</code> and <code>~&gt;</code> for your custom edge.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>	In case of mixed graphs you may also design your own hierarchy of
	custom edge classes.
</p>
<p> Note that custom edges to be passed in an <code>EdgeInputStream </code> must
	also implement <code>Attributes</code>. This case is described in the JSON
	User Guide since JSON import utilizes Streams.

<h2>Defining User Constraints</h2>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="/guides/constrained.html">Constrained User Guide</a>.</p>
<h2>Modifying Methods</h2>
<p> You might want to modify methods of the library implementation of <code>Graph</code>
	or its inner traits <code>InnerNodeLike</code>, <code>NodeSet</code>,
	<code>InnerEdgeLike</code> or <code>EdgeSet</code> to alter their run-time behavior.
	However, be careful not to alter method semantics but add your own methods whenever
	applicable.
