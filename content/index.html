<h1>Welcome to <span class="orange">scalax.collection.Graph</span></h1>
<p>Graph for Scala is intended to provide basic graph functionality seamlessly fitting into the Scala Collection Library. Like the well known members of <code>scala.collection</code>, Graph for Scala is an in-memory graph library aiming at editing and traversing graphs, finding cycles etc. in a user-friendly way. Besides ready-to-go implementations of JSON-Import/-Export and Dot-Export, more popular graph formats, mirroring of graph databases as well as distributed processing are due to be supported.
Graph for Scala was originally planned to move from here to the Scala Extended Core Library, a new facility to be launched sometime later by the Scala Core Team. Until then, use this Scala Incubator site to <a href="https://www.assembla.com/spaces/scala-graph/documents">read up on</a> Graph for Scala.</p>


<p>To download the latest release 1.6.1 of the core module, SBT users will have to add</p>

<pre>libraryDependencies += "com.assembla.scala-incubator" % "graph-core_2.10" % "1.6.1"</pre>

<p>As a Maven user, please set group id to <code>com.assembla.scala-incubator</code>, artifact id to <code>graph-core_2.10</code> and version to <code>1.6.0</code>.</p>

<p>The latest stable releases of the optional modules are:</p>
