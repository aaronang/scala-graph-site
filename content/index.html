<h1>Welcome to <span class="orange">scalax.collection.Graph</span></h1>
<p>
  Graph for Scala is intended to provide basic graph functionality that seamlessly fits into the Scala
  standard collections library. Like the other members of <code>scala.collection</code>, Graph for Scala
  is an in-memory container that exposes a user-friendly interface without sacrificing functionality or
  flexibility.
</p>

<p>
  Graph for Scala also has ready-to-go implementations of JSON-Import/Export and Dot-Export - more popular
  graph serialization formats are coming soon. In addition, other powerful tools such as graph databases
  emulation and distributed graph processing are due to be supported.
</p>

<p>
  A new facility called the Scala Extended Core Library is due to be launched sometime later by the Scala
  team - until then, please use this website to read up on Graph for Scala.
